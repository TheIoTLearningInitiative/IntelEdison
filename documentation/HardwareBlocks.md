> With over a dozen boards to design, our engineers had to begin by coming up with a standardized layout so they’d all work together. We began by painstakingly laying out a general purpose escape route – a set of traces and vias that would break all of the signals out, while also passing them from the bottom connector to the top. Then we built in rules like where inputs and outputs should go, or where the board should generally be void of connectors. Sparkfun
