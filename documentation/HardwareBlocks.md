## Sparkfun

> With over a dozen boards to design, our engineers had to begin by coming up with a standardized layout so they’d all work together. We began by painstakingly laying out a general purpose escape route – a set of traces and vias that would break all of the signals out, while also passing them from the bottom connector to the top. Then we built in rules like where inputs and outputs should go, or where the board should generally be void of connectors. Sparkfun

## Audio Block for Intel Edison

> Audio Block is an add-on board for Intel Edison compute module. It provides audio playback and recording capabilities using the I2S/DSP interface present in the Intel Edison. Audio Block supports stereo output (either as a line output, or as a headphones output using a built-in amplifier), a stereo line input, or and microphone input. Malinov Homepage
