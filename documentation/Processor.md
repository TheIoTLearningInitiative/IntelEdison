> In March 2014, Intel announced changes in the Intel Edison project and the second version of the board was presented in September 2014. Its dimensions are 35.5 x 25 x 3.9 mm, with components on both sides. The board's main SoC is a 22 nm Intel Atom "Tangier" (Z34XX) that includes two Atom Silvermont cores running at 500 MHz and one Intel Quark core at 100 MHz (for executing RTOS ViperOS). The SoC has 1 GB RAM integrated on package. There is also 4 GB eMMC flash on board, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4 and USB controllers. The board has 70-pin dense connector (Hirose DF40) with USB, SD, UARTs, GPIOs. The price of the device is around 50 USD. It runs Yocto Linux with development support for Arduino IDE, Eclipse (C, C++, Python), Intel XDK (NodeJS, HTML5), and Wolfram.

> Intel® Atom™ Processor Z34xx Series is the next generation 22 nm SoC product targeted for the smartphone market segment. The SoC contains dual IA-32 cores operating at 500 MHz. The architecture includes 2-wide instruction decode and Out Of Order Execution with 1 MB cache shared between the two CPU cores. It includes Intel SIMD Extensions 2, 3, 4 (SSE2, SSE3, SSE4.1/4.2).
