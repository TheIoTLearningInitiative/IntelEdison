> The SoC has 1 GB RAM integrated on package. There is also 4 GB eMMC flash on board, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4 and USB controllers. The board has 70-pin dense connector (Hirose DF40) with USB, SD, UARTs, GPIOs. Wikipedia

## Embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC)

> The eMMC architecture puts the MMC components (flash memory plus controller) into a small ball grid array (BGA) IC package for use in circuit boards as an embedded non-volatile memory system. Wikipedia

## Bluetooth
> The host processor on the Intel® Edison development board is connected to a Broadcom* BCM43340 combo chip via UART (uart0 mapped to /dev/MFD0) as transport layer and uses additional GPIOs to handle power (on, reset, etc.), OOB (
out-of-band) signaling for UART to support low power mode. ...
