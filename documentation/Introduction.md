Introduction

> The Intel Edison is a tiny computer offered by Intel as a development system for wearable devices[1] and Internet of Things devices. The system was initially announced to be the same size and shape as an SD card and containing a dual-core Intel Quark x86 CPU at 400 MHz communicating via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. A later announcement changed the CPU to a 22 nm Silvermont dual-core Intel Atom CPU,[5] and in September 2014 a second version of Edison was shown at IDF, which was bigger and thicker than a standard SD card.
