Pin Multiplexor
==

Owner: Lynette


Suggested outline:

* What is pin multiplexing?
* How to create a map of Edison pins/conf (for Edison-Arduino breakout, Edison mini-breakout board. Being the goal to not fully rely on community pin tables or data sheet)
* D-J play that "mux-ic" (how to actually change the pin configuration, through an example and watch it come alive through examples)
* Try to apply the knowledge acquired to a small part of a bigger problem, probably ask the participant to plan the pin configuration he is going to need for the  training project.
